For years, Sallomé dreamed of giving every high school student in America a life coach. She never dreamed that she’d actually find a job that allowed her to do that. Sallomé co-founded Plan It Brooklyn, a brain trust for entrepreneurs and emerging leaders, and produced A Great Day in Brooklyn, a visual blueprint she created of Brooklyn residents merging the worlds of art, activism and entrepreneurship. At The Future Project, Sallomé designs and creates trainings for our Dream Directors, and runs our Dream Director recruitment.

Andy’s spent his life building and crafting creative projects, obsessing over every little detail. That craftsman’s attention to the little things carries over into his work at The Future Project, where he’s in charge of the look, feel, and design of the visual brand. He makes sure that the creative work the team puts out into the world communicates our values and vision.

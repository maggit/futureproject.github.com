As the Dream Director at High School in the Community in New Haven, CT, Christian has used his passion for the arts to transform the halls of the school into a community art gallery, and brought scores of alumni back to the school to support current students. In these and many other ways, he’s been working with students, teachers and alumni to find ways they can reimagine, recreate, and completely own the identity of their school.

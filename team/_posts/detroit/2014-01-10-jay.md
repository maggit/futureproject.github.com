Born and raised in Detroit, Jay always had an undying love for his city. By committing his life to networking, being a connector and encouraging residents of Detroit old and new, this opportunity as a Dream Director is a dream come true and an amazing way to use past experiences and grouped resources to push students to their true passion and dreams.

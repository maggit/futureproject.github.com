6 years as an organizer, social justice educator, and radical feeler, William finds himself holistically involved with youth. Residing in Michigan for over 25 years, he vehemently believes in processes of reimagining education through youth-driven practices and understands the importance of youth locating themselves personally, socially, politically, and historically–within the past, present, and future.

When George was growing up in New Haven, he never imagined that he’d be devoting a big part of his life to the city that raised him. In fact, he was convinced at one point that he needed to move away, only to be drawn back. A skilled storyteller, George is giving the students at The Riverside Academy in New Haven, where he’s the Dream Director, an opportunity to tell a new story about their school and city.

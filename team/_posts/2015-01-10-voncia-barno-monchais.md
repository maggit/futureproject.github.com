Voncia spent years as a history teacher in Miami, where she was also a Teach for America corps member. The granddaughter of a civil rights activist, Voncia always had a desire to work with young people as they discover their voices, create and own who they are, and build a world of equality and respect. It’s what she did as a teacher, and what she is continuing as Dream Director at Eastern Senior High School in Washington, DC.

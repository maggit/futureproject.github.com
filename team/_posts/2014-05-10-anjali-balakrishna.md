Although her official title is Chief of Staff, you could call Anjali our Great Dot Connector, working across the organization to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. She is lucky enough to get to work with every member of the team on a daily basis—from our Dream Directors in Detroit to our volunteers in New York to our President and CEO. She knows that a happy and connected team can do just about anything, and she’ll stop at nothing to ensure that The Future Project crew is fully unleashed.

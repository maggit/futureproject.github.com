## Our country is uninspired, unfulfilled, and losing hope.

America is supposed to be a place of possibility. But amid major challenges, we’ve become more pessimistic than ever before. Worst of all, millions of young people are growing up hopeless and disengaged, without the belief or the skills they need to lead in the 21st century.

1. #### Millions of Americans are living unhappy, unfulfilled lives and don’t have faith in the future.
